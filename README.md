## About me
My name is Patryk Radom and I am a beginner Software Tester. I acquired basic skills from the testing area, such as basic knowledge of software testing, test design techniques, the concept of modern software development processes and testing tools, during the 105-hour course "Software Tester" in The Software Development Academy. I also have 5 years of experience working as a Project Manager. During this period, I learned to implement my projects with attention to detail and to work effectively in a group. My advantage is also great work organization - also remotely. I am learning foreign languages (English, German) every day, at least 20 - 30 minutes, using sites and mobile apps - repeatability is the key. Recently, I discovered my passion connected with testing. My goal is to develop testing knowledge and technical skills, by attending to courses, webinars, reading books, which I will describe further below. On this site I would like to share my all gained experience from personal studies and researches.
